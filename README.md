<B>Introduction</B>

This application is a demonstration to show how Heroku, Salesforce.com and an IOS application can work together to create a compelling customer experience.  It is provided for the study and enjoyment of users. Please note that this is not designed or intended to be a production application.

The application is designed to show how the Salesforce account and case objects can be replicated across multiple applications using APIs exposed by Heroku and Salesforce. The application federates identity in the Heroku application to the Salesforce account object, and allows Heroku users to create ‘incidents’ (Salesforce cases) to report damage to public property. This can be processed and reported on in Salesforce, and is also viewable in the IOS application.
